# [BRASS] Bronzeman and adjustable saveslots
## About
This mod adds two features:
### 1. Bronzeman mode
Bronzeman mode is a softer version of ironman mode. Where ironman only has one
save game, bronzeman has multiple save games, that are consecutively overwritten
whenever the game decides to make an autosave. The idea here is to make backups of
your ironman run, in case your save game gets corrupted, e.g. if you play with mods,
without the need of playing in normal mode.

This obviously allows you to save-scum in ironman, but you could also do that
without the mod, so you can consider this a QoL feature, for that use case.

### 2. Additional save slots
The mod allows you to have additional autosave and quicksave slots and 
allows you to adjust how many additional slots you want.

## Required Mods
Requires the following mods:

## Compatibility 
- In theory compatible with [More Save Slots,](https://www.nexusmods.com/battlebrothers/mods/389)
but I added it as incompatible because one probably supersedes the other.
- Probably compatible with all other mods.
- Hooks into "world_state" and "asset_manger"
