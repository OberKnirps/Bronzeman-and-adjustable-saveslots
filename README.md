# [BRASS] Bronzeman and adjustable saveslots
## About
IF YOU HAVE "Hide additional Ironman slots" ENABLED AND DELETE THE REGULAR 
IRONMAN SAVE, IT WILL DELETE ALL BACKUPS AND BRONZEMAN SAVES AS WELL. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

This mod adds two features:
### 1. Bronzeman mode
Bronzeman mode is a softer version of ironman mode. The Bronzeman settings 
allow you to make your ironman a bit easier by adding more savegames while preserving 
the permadeath of ironman and no custom savesgames. Do you want to savescum without 
the need of Alt+F4 (most of the time) by simply reloading ingame? Set the savegame 
option to 'Ingame' or 'Both', to reload an ironman game mid-campaign. Not happy with the results 
of a fight? Enable pre combat savegames. Want to tryout something in a settlement 
without leaving the game to make a backup and restoring it later? Use the settlement save options.

While all this is called bronzeman, you are not actually playing in a separate 
game mode but still in ironman. This means you will still get the ironman 
achievements. Some might call that cheating, but let's be honest, you could also do that
without the mod, by backing up the files. So play the game the way you want, as long as you enjoy it.

### 2. Additional save slots
The mod allows you to have additional autosave, quicksave and ironman savegames and 
allows you to adjust how many additional slots you want.

## Compatibility 
- In theory compatible with [More Save Slots,](https://www.nexusmods.com/battlebrothers/mods/389)
but I added it as incompatible because one probably supersedes the other.
- Probably compatible with all other mods.
